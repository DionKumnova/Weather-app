# Weather app for the visually impaired - IN2000 Software Engineering
As part of the course “IN2000 Software Engineering,” we were assigned to teams and tasked with developing a fully-fledged Android app using Android Studio and Kotlin. Given a choice among five types of applications, my team and I decided to develop a weather app for the visually impaired.
